                  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                  I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                  free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                  grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                  at a VR startup. ”

                  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
                  particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
                  level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
                  often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                  developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                  full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
                  recommend! ”
